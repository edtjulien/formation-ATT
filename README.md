Notebooks for deep learning model training with Tensorflow. Training purpose is to predict if a text is a spam or not.

Notebooks are:
* `att.ipynb` with baseline model and with a LSTM based model
* `att_bert.ipynb` who used transfer learning on a BERT model

Best model is the BERT based model. But very close to the baseline model. F1 score is around 0.94 and accuracy 0,96.
